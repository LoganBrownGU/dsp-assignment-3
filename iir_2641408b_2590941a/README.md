# Wireless laser data transmission 
Video: https://youtu.be/iLDZ0yH2ANQ

This project involves sending data wirelessly using a laser and a phototransistor as a detector. 

The files `receiver.py` and `transmission.py` should be run simultaneously, in separate terminals. This will allow you to input text into the transmitter and see it come up on the receiver.
